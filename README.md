Snackjack
=========

Snackjack is a blackjack command line python game currently that I hope to add a web UI to in the future. It's mostly for coding practice but it's really for blackjack practice so that I can redeem myself next time I'm in Vegas.

**Backlog:**
* Finish the game for command line
* Add in some pretty cards in the command line maybe?
* Collapse Dealer and Player into proper inheritance heriarchy
* Make web interface
* Obtain license to run online gambling table
* Profit
